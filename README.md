# GOOGLE BOOKS API SEARCH ENGINE

Part of the _nology course's project to create a search engine that utilises Google's Google Book API.

This project's purpose is to demostrate my competency with Vite React, React hooks and fetching data from APIs.

The website is reactive to both desktop/laptop layouts and phone layouts and also showcases my understanding of graphic design. All SVGs on this site were made by myself on SVGator.

As This project uses the Google Books API I have decided to theme the site with Google's iconic colour pallet as well as take inspiration from the designs used on their other applications. 

The search bar can take in any term and as such the API will pull in a wide range of results. Type more into the search bar for more specific results.

Note that this is not an official Google application.
